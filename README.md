# Twilio Video virtual waiting room

This is an example video chat application built with [Twilio Video](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video), Express, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Preparing the application

To run the application you will need a [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) and Node.js and npm installed. Start by cloning or downloading the repo to your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/annthurium/virtual-waiting-room.git
cd virtual-waiting-room
```

Install the dependencies:

Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Credentials

You will need your Twilio Account SID, available in your [Twilio console](https://www.twilio.com/console). Add it to the `.env` file.

You will also need an API key and secret, you can create these under the [Programmable Video Tools in your console](https://www.twilio.com/console/video/project/api-keys). Create a key pair and add them to the `.env` file too.

## Running the application
